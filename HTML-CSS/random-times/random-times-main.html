          <li>Best life decision so far: 10 day silent retreat in 2017. "There is life before learning meditation and life after learning meditation."</li>
          <li>Worst life decision so far: Threw a rock in front of a driving car when he was a teenager because someone dared him to do it. He had seen Back To The Future, yet seemingly learned nothing of it.</li>
