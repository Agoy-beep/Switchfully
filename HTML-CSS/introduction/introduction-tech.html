      <h2>Testimony</h2>
      </br>
      <p>I start this training with no formal IT education whatsoever. I've always been interested in coding but until recently I never quite found the time to get into it. I did some tutorials on Sololearn to get my bearings and decided to keep an eye open for courses or possible career changes, because I'd been stuck in a rut in my current line of work and was really having fun coding. I read an article about Switchfully some time ago and applied for a job at Cegeka in 2018. I made my way through the selection process but due to obligations to my current employer, I had to let the opportunity go. This year I tried again with the position at CM and obviously this time everything worked out.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>In preparing for the selection process, I got some basic introduction to Java and have been trying to make small console programs on my cellphone, using an IDE called JStudio. So far I've made a quiz, an early version of a program to help me remember when to plant and harvest vegetables and herbs in my garden, a mini choose-your-own-adventure and trying to figure out how to code an inventory system for text-based RPG's.</p>
