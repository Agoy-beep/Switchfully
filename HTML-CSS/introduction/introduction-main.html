        <ul>
          <li>Name: Arne Goyvaerts</li>
          <li>Born January 12th 1986.</li>
          <li>Lives in Mortsel, near Antwerp, with his fianc√©e, baby girl and adult cat, whom they adopted (the latter, not the former).</li>
          <li>Studied Latin and Science in high school, tossed all of that aside to study music for 4 years, then became a social worker.</li>
          <li>Worked with mentally challenged people for 10 years, specialised in Autism Spectrum Disorder and agressive behavior.</li>
          <li>Started out as a football player, moved on to martial arts after making a 3-month trip through South-East Asia and watching Kung Fu Panda (ha-ha).</li>
          <li>Avid environmentalist.</li>
          <li>Best life decision so far: 10 day silent Vipassana retreat. "There is life before learning meditation and life after learning meditation."</li>
          <li>Worst life decision so far: Threw a rock in front of a driving car when he wasn't even a teenager because someone dared him to do it. He had seen <a href= "https://youtu.be/-_GkY6CEFtM" target = "blank">Back To The Future</a>, yet seemingly learned nothing of it.</li>
          <li>Childhood hero: Indiana Jones.</li>
          <li>Is left handed, thus has to pay more for his guitars.</li>
          <li>Is most famous for: writing 3+ hours of additional, and completely unasked for, music for a game called The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. (So yeah...not very famous.)</li>
